# demo_polymorphism

- Understanding of Polymorphism: Demonstrates how polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the class that implements them.
- Use of Abstract Base Classes (ABC): Shows how to define an abstract base class using the abc module and enforce the implementation of abstract methods in subclass definitions.
- Implementation of Abstract Methods: Highlights the requirement for derived classes to implement abstract methods defined in an abstract base class.
- Use of Concrete Methods: Demonstrates how concrete methods provide default implementations that derived classes can either use directly or override.
- Implementation of Method Overriding: Shows how derived classes can override methods of the base class to provide specific behaviors.
- Error Handling: By attempting to instantiate a class (Mystery) that does not implement its required abstract methods, it showcases understanding of the errors Python will raise in such scenarios, specifically the TypeError for abstract methods.
- Understanding of Inheritance: Displays how classes can inherit from a base class and the importance of doing so for code reuse and organization.
- Practical Application of OOP Principles: Applies key object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism in a practical example.
